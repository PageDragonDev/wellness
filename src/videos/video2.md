Breast augmentation surgery includes breast enlargement, breast enhancement and breast lift procedures. Breast Augmentation involves using breast implants or fat (referred to as fat transfer breast augmentation), to increase the size of your breasts. Many women want breast surgery or a breast lift after pregnancy or significant weight loss to restore the volume and shape of their breasts. If you have had breast cancer and part or all of your breast is missing or you are unbalanced after radiation, then insurance will cover your breast surgery to balance shape and size. Breast reconstruction surgery using implants can also be performed after a mastectomy or injury.

## Benefits of Breast Augmentation
* Increase fullness and projection of your breasts
* Improve the balance of your figure
* Enhance your self-image and self-confidence

## What Makes a Good Candidate for Breast Augmentation Surgery
If your breasts leave you dissatisfied either in size or shape, and you are physically healthy, you may be a good candidate for breast enlargement surgery. But you have to have realistic expectations about breast enhancement. Call Dr. Bowen today to set up a consultation to discuss breast surgery options.
