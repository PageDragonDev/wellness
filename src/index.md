specialty1_text: '### Nutrient Support

  We do not always have the time or resources when it comes to proper diet and nutrition.  Long lasting nutritional imbalance can lead to illness and disease, showing the importance of replenishing these vitamins and minerals.  Often a combination of supplements and IV Nutritional Therapy will be needed to help “catch you back up” from accumulated nutritional deficit. Here at Centered on Wellness, Nutrient Therapy can help!

  ### Stress Management

  We live in an age of constant stress and strain physically, mentally, and emotionally.  We are often nutritionally depleted and without the support we need to get re-balanced.  The standard solution currently is to be put on medication that promises to blunt our response and help us feel calm while offering no real lasting solutions.  If you are looking for an alternative way with lasting solutions Centered on Wellness can help!

      #### Patient

      "Information is power.  Centered on wellness gave me the information I was looking for by providing me with a detailed analysis of how to achieve optimal health.  My primary care physician keeps me healthy but he does not have time to help me achieve the best possible health.  A program like centered on wellness is long overdue.  I am 52, healthy and feel good.  But I want more.  Centered on wellness gives me the knowledge to fight against and take control over the aging process."

      ### Hugh Adams

      #### Ironman Florida 11/4/2018

      "After training all summer for IronMan Florida, my body and immune system was somewhat
      compromised I decided to visit Dr, Sage Campione for an IV infusion of important vitamins to help bolster my recovering body. Under Centered on Wellness' care, I had 3 infusions with Giutathione added to help recovery on a cellular level. This procedure assisted me in completing my goal with the IronMan Florida competition. My recovery was quick and I have been able to start back training for my next season quickly, Thank you Centered on Wellness and staff for helping me compete on a level I could not achieve alone."
