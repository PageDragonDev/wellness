What is gynecomastia surgery?

Gynecomastia surgery reduces breast size in men, flattening and enhancing the chest contours.

In severe cases of gynecomastia, the weight of excess breast tissue may cause the breasts to sag and stretch the areola (the dark skin surrounding the nipple). In these cases the position and size of the areola can be surgically improved and excess skin may be reduced.

Plastic surgery to correct gynecomastia is technically called reduction mammaplasty.

What is gynecomastia?

Gynecomastia is a condition of overdeveloped or enlarged breasts in men that can occur at any age. The condition can be the result of hormonal changes, heredity, obesity or the use of certain drugs.

Gynecomastia can cause emotional discomfort and impair your self-confidence. Some men may even avoid certain physical activities and intimacy simply to hide their condition.

Gynecomastia is characterized by:

* 

Excess localized fat

* Excess glandular tissue development
* Sometimes excess breast skin
* Presence unilaterally (one breast) or bilaterally (both breasts)
