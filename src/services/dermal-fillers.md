  Fillers are often used to treat fine lines, wrinkles, and age-related volume
  loss that cause cheeks to flatten and skin to sag. Over time, skin loses
  elasticity. This natural process, plus genetics and environmental factors like
  sun exposure, can cause moderate to severe lines and folds such as
  parentheses, corner, and marionette lines to form around the nose and mouth.
  Dermal fillers can help fill these lines and give you natural looking results
  that last.

Some women may wish to add subtle volume to their lips; others may want to soften the appearance of their vertical lip lines. Unwanted lines such as these are often caused by factors such as sun exposure or repeated muscle movement. JUVÉDERM® adds subtle volume to lips and softens the lines around the mouth. With the JUVÉDERM® Collection of Fillers that Dr. Bowen’s office offers we can help you achieve your desired results.

**Sculptra® Aesthetic** is an injectable treatment that works with your body to revitalize collagen production, helping to restore your skin’s inner structure. The solution that is injected into your skin stimulates your skin’s own natural collagen production to increase overall facial volume.  This treatment works subtly and gradually over time for results that can last more than 2 years. Typically patients need to receive 3 to 4 treatments to see optimum results.

If you wish to treat more than just wrinkles, lines and folds, and are looking for a gradual, subtle result that lasts longer than typical instant results-driven non-surgical  procedure, this may be an option for you to address facial aging and volume loss of collagen. Please call to schedule a consultation with Dr. Bowen to see if you would be a good candidate for Sculptra® Aesthetic.

**Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Facial**

* Improve skin tone and texture
* Tighten skin that has started to lose its elasticity
* Soften fine lines and reduce pore size

PRP is a natural product created from your own body. Blood is drawn from you and placed into a centrifuge. Your blood is spun down allowing the separation of red and white blood cells from the platelets and plasma. Platelets are the cells in the blood that help tissue to heal and grow new cells. 

When PRP is injected into the skin it helps promote collagen to grow, regenerate tissue, and help to smooth and tighten the skin.  PRP is used for adding volume to faces that are beginning to look drawn, plump out cheek indentations, soften under eye hollows, improve skin tone, tightness, and overall texture. 

PRP has a long history of being used in orthopedic medicine, dentistry, and reconstructive surgery. Results from this treatment begin to show 3-4 weeks post treatment and continue to improve with time. Three treatment sessions are generally recommended, 4-6 weeks apart, to achieve the best outcome. 

PRP can be combined with laser, Botox, injectables to best target a patient’s unique issues and thus achieve desired results of younger, healthier looking skin.
