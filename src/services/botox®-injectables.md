What should I expect from a BOTOX® Cosmetic Treatment?

BOTOX® Cosmetic is the only approved treatment to temporarily improve the appearance of both moderate to severe frown lines between the brows and crow’s feet lines in adults.

You may begin to notice results within 24 to 48 hours for moderate to severe frown lines, with results lasting up to 4 months.

The actual injection process takes about 10 minutes. Dr. Bowen will discuss your treatment goals and perform a facial analysis to determine the appropriate treatment areas for you.

BOTOX® Cosmetic is a technique-sensitive treatment. You should not lose the ability to show expression when you are treated by someone who is licensed, trained, and a medical expert in facial anatomy.
