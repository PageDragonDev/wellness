A facelift, or rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure that improves visible signs of aging in the face and neck, such as:

* Relaxation of the skin of the face causing sagging
* Deepening of the fold lines between the nose and corner of the mouth
* Fat that has fallen or has disappeared
* Jowls developing in the cheeks and jaw
* Loose skin and excess fat of the neck that can appear as a double chin or "turkey neck"

The loss of youthful contours in the face can be due to variety of factors, including thinning of the skin, loss of facial fat, gravity, sun damage, smoking, as well as heredity and stress.

Other procedures that might be performed in conjunction with a facelift are brow lift and eyelid surgery to rejuvenate aging eyes. Fat transfer or fillers may be suggested to replace the lost fatty volume. Skin treatments such as IPL, dermabrasion, peels or laser may be offered to improve the quality and texture of the skin.

## What facelift surgery can't do
As a restorative surgery, a facelift does not change your fundamental appearance and cannot stop the aging process.

A facelift can only be performed surgically; minimally invasive rejuvenation treatments cannot achieve the same results, but may help delay the time at which a facelift becomes appropriate and complement the results of surgery.

Some minimally invasive treatments, such as stem cell facelifts, are of unproven benefit.
