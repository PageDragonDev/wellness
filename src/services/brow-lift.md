Brow/Forehead Lift

A brow lift, also known as a forehead lift, reduces wrinkle lines, improves frown lines, raises sagging eyebrows and places the eyebrows in a youthful position. May be covered by insurance if interferes with vision. Requires 2-4 weeks recovery.

A brow lift:

* 

Reduces the wrinkle lines that develop horizontally across the forehead, as well as those that occur on the bridge of the nose, between the eyes

* Improves frown lines, the vertical creases that develop between the eyebrows
* Raises sagging brows that are hooding the upper eyelids
* Places the eyebrows in an alert and youthful position
