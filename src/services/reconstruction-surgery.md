What is body contouring?

Dramatic weight loss has many benefits. But after any substantial amount of weight loss due to weight loss surgery and/or lifestyle changes, the skin and tissues often lack the elasticity to conform to the reduced body size.

Surgical body contouring following major weight loss removes excess sagging skin and fat while improving the shape of the underlying support tissue. The result is a better-proportioned appearance with smoother contours.

Body contouring procedures may include
:

* Arm lift: correct sagging of the upper arms
* Breast lift: correct sagging, flattened breasts
* Facelift: correct sagging of the mid-face, jowls and neck
* Lower body lifts: correct sagging of the abdomen, buttocks, inner and outer thighs
* Medial thigh lift: correct sagging of the inner thigh
* Tummy tuck: correct apron of excess skin hanging over the abdomen

Who is a good candidate for body contouring?

In general, good body contouring candidates are:

* 

Adults whose weight loss has stabilized

* Healthy individuals without medical conditions that impair healing or increase risk of surgery
* Nonsmokers
* Individuals with a positive outlook and realistic goals
* Individuals that are committed to leading a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and fitness
