What is a neck lift?

A neck lift, or lower rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure that improves visible signs of aging in the jawline and neck.

What neck lift surgery can treat:

* Excess fat and skin relaxation in the lower face that creates jowls
* Excess fatty deposits under the chin
* Loose neck skin
* Muscle banding in the neck, which created abnormal contours
* The loss of youthful contours in the face and neck can be due to a variety of factors, including heredity, gravity, environmental conditions and stress.

Some people feel they are not ready for a full facelift because the upper face is still pleasing. However, many patients will note excess wrinkling of the neck skin, a double chin or "turkey wattle" and jowl lines.

When the neck area doesn't match the upper facial appearance, a neck lift may be a good solution.

Rejuvenation procedures that can be performed in conjunction with a neck lift are: a brow lift, to correct a sagging or deeply furrowed brow, fat transfer, to add fullness to the lips and cheeks and reduce the appearance of wrinkles, or eyelid surgery, to rejuvenate aging eyes.

What neck lift surgery can't do:

As a restorative surgery, a neck lift does not change your fundamental appearance and cannot stop the aging process.

A neck lift can only be performed surgically; nonsurgical rejuvenation treatments cannot achieve the same results, but may help delay the time at which a neck lift becomes appropriate and complement the results of surgery.
