 -Lumecca by Inmode for Clear, Beautiful Skin

Improve the appearance of:

* 

Age spots (red or brown pigmentations)

* Vascular lesions (veins, telangiectasia, port wine stains)
* Rosacea (redness)
* Freckles
* Sun Damage

Lumecca is the most powerful intense pulsed light (IPL) to treat pigmented and vascular lesions. After just one use, patients notice significant improvements in the complexion and clarity of the skin. Lumecca operates using photothermolysis, which provides a photofacial through the delivery of a comfortable light treatment. 

The Lumecca can be used on all areas of the body but the most common areas of treatment are zones that are regularly exposed to the sun, such as, face, neck, decolletage, legs, hands and arms.
