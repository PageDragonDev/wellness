What eyelid surgery can treat:

* Loose or sagging skin that creates folds or disturbs the natural contour of the upper eyelid, sometimes impairing vision
* Fatty deposits that appear as puffiness in the eyelids
* Bags under the eyes
* Drooping lower eyelids that reveal white below the iris
* Excess skin and fine wrinkles of the lower eyelid

Who is a good candidate for eyelid surgery?

Good candidates for eyelid surgery include:

* Healthy individuals with no medical conditions that can impair healing
* Nonsmokers
* Individuals with a positive outlook and realistic goals
* Individuals without serious eye conditions

Remember that the eyelids are part of the face. The appearance of a drooping upper lid may also be due to relaxation of the forehead skin and eyebrow. Sometimes stretching out of the upper eyelid muscle may cause a drooping eyelid. This is called eyelid ptosis and requires a different surgical treatment.

Your plastic surgeon will evaluate your facial anatomy thoroughly and will discuss what procedures might best remedy your concerns.
