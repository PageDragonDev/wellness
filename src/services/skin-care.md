## Microdermabrasion

Microdermabrasion treatments use a minimally abrasive instrument to gently sand your skin, removing the thicker, uneven outer layer.

This type of skin rejuvenation is used to treat light scarring, discoloration, sun damage and stretch marks.

What microdermabrasion can do:
* Improve age spots and black heads
* Improve hyperpigmentation (patches of darkened skin)
* Exfoliate your skin, resulting in a refreshed appearance
* Lessen the appearance of stretch marks.
* Reduce fine lines and wrinkles
* Reduce or eliminate enlarged pores
* Treat acne and the scars left by acne
