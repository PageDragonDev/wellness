Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy is a popular option for millions of women who want to improve their health and lifestyle during the changes of life that occur with pre-menopause, perimenopause, and menopause. BHRT is also a very effective treatment for those who suffer from premenstrual symptoms (PMS).

## Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) Program for Women

Bio-identical hormone therapy may help patients find relief from the symptoms they are
experiencing from imbalanced hormones. At Centered on Wellness, we create
customized, medically sound programs that include bio-identical hormone replacement,
fitness and nutrition plans.

_Individual female hormone replacement treatment programs include_

* Treatment by Dr. Sage Campione, who is highly trained in Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy
* Full review of symptoms, including personal and family medical history
* Comprehensive hormone level testing
* Thorough analysis of lab results
* Customized programs to alleviate specific symptoms based on personal medical history and lab result analysis
* Compounded hormones and supplements
* Nutritional and fitness recommendations and support

### Treatment
* Creams and Gels – This treatment is usually applied to the skin; however, in some
circumstances, the creams can be inserted directly into the vagina for specific
treatment reasons.
* Tablets/troches –are a common and effective way to administer BHRT. Tablets are
taken every day by mouth. While tablets have gotten a bad reputation in some
circles, that reputation was incorrectly applied to true Bio-identical estrogen. The
bad reputation is applied to estrogens obtained from horse urine and chemicalized
synthetic progestins that are NOT used by Dr. Sage

### Follow-Up

Dr. Sage Campione will schedule appointments to continually monitor your hormone
levels and to review the alleviation of your symptoms. Treatment will be revised as
necessary until optimal balance is achieved.

loss of hormones. In men, this is called andropause or “male menopause” and refers
mainly to decreasing levels of testosterone.

### Treatment

Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy for men is available in many forms.
Through an evaluation of your unique symptoms and a thorough review of saliva, urine
and blood tests, Dr. Sage Campione will make a recommendation that is best for you.
Recommended treatment options include:

* Creams and Gels – Testosterone is absorbed very well through the skin in most
people and can be a simple and very effective delivery method. In some cases,
though, men will have trouble getting adequate levels of testosterone when using
transdermal delivery. Transdermal delivery also risks having the hormone rub off or
“transfer” to others who should not be exposed to such high levels of hormone.
* Injections– Testosterone can also be injected directly into the muscles and can be
a very effective way to increase levels of testosterone. This method does, however,
require weekly or most often, twice-weekly injections to get adequate and constant
levels of the hormone.

### Follow-Up

Dr.Sage Campione will schedule appointments to continually monitor your hormone
levels and to review the alleviation of your symptoms. Treatment will be revised as
necessary until the optimum balance is achieved.
