Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy is a popular option for millions of women who want to improve their health and lifestyle during the changes of life that occur with pre-menopause, perimenopause, and menopause.

## Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) Program for Women

Bio-identical hormone therapy may help patients find relief from the symptoms they are experiencing from imbalanced hormones. At Centered on Wellness, we create customized, medically sound programs that include bio-identical hormone replacement, fitness and nutrition plans.

_Individual female hormone replacement treatment programs include_

* Treatment by a highly trained Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapist
* Full review of symptoms, including personal and family medical history
* Comprehensive hormone level testing
* Thorough analysis of lab results
* Customized programs to alleviate specific symptoms based on personal medical history and lab result analysis
* Compounded hormones and supplements
* Nutritional and fitness recommendations and support

### Treatment
* **Creams and Gels** – This treatment is usually applied to the skin; however, in some
circumstances, the creams can be inserted directly into the vagina for specific
treatment reasons.
* **Tablets/troches** –are a common and effective way to administer BHRT. Tablets are
taken every day by mouth. While tablets have gotten a bad reputation in some
circles, that reputation was incorrectly applied to true Bio-identical estrogen. The
bad reputation is applied to estrogens obtained from horse urine and chemicalized
synthetic progestins that are NOT used in our treatment

### Follow-Up

We will schedule appointments to continually monitor your hormone
levels and to review the alleviation of your symptoms. Treatment will be revised as
necessary until optimal balance is achieved.
