We do not always have the time or resources when it comes to proper diet and nutrition. Many diseases are the result of long-lasting nutritional imbalance, which shows the importance of replenishing these vitamins and minerals. Nutritional Therapy can help!

Here at Centered on Wellness, our mission is to provide total person wellness and care. Each of us is created uniquely and therefore requires different care.  Often you can benefit from a combination of oral supplements and nutrient infusion therapy to help “catch you up” from your accumulated nutritional losses

## Who is a candidate for Nutrient Therapy?

Anyone who is interested in a holistic, preventative approach to health care 

## Is this something covered by my health insurance?

Our mission of wellness and prevention does not fit into an insurance dictated model of sickness management. Therefore, we do not participate with any insurance providers including Medicare.

## What can I expect, and does it hurt?

* To begin this process, we would set you up for a meet and greet with our patient care coordinator, where she will bring you into the office to get a tour of the facility, fill out your necessary paperwork, and receive more detailed information of what to expect during this process.  Next you will be scheduled for a consultation where you will discuss your health history and wellness goals with one of our providers.  Lab work will be ordered and can be done in our office for your convenience.  Once your lab work is received, we will schedule you for a lab review to discuss in detail your results and to formulate your treatment plan.  There will be check-ins along the way of your treatment plan to ensure your wellness goals are on track to be met.
* Your treatment plan may include Nutrient Infusion (Intravenous) therapy, which we provide for you in the comfort of our relaxation room. 
* You can enjoy some quiet time seated in a reclining chair and can read, nap, listen to music, do needlework, or the latest Sudoku puzzle, while your NI therapy is in progress  
* Most of the Nutrient Therapy treatments range between 20-90 minutes to infuse.  Some of our more therapeutic regimens require 2-3 hours. .  
* There is little to no pain and in most cases, very little discomfort.  Some people experience a warm sensation, and some say that they can taste the vitamins – this is especially true if you are very depleted
* \*\**Please be sure to eat and/or bring a snack so that you do not arrive with an empty stomach.  Some Nutrient therapies require hydration during administration, so you may bring drinks of your choice. 

## How often should I get a treatment?

Many conditions often require an intense initial period of treatments and oral supplements that transition to a maintenance phase.

The initial phase can vary but is commonly 1-3 times per week for a period of up to 3 months, with a maintenance phase of 1-4 times per month for 3-6 months.  

Preventative and anti-aging treatments are typically recommended 2-4 times a month

Our goal here at Centered on Wellness is your long-term health and wellness. If this sound likes a partnership you would like to explore further, please call our office to set up a wellness consultation with one of our qualified providers.
