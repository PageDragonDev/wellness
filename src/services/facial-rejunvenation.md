Rejuvenate & restore your skin


.Discover a superior solution to decrease wrinkles, improve skin complexion, reduce skin irregularities (including acne/acne scars) and provide a healthier younger looking you! Fractora skin treatment is a fractional rejuvenation that combines radio frequency with microneedling. 

This treatment is designed to create a controlled trauma to the skin in which the body produces collagen and elastin to repair resulting in a reduction in wrinkles, fine lines, and improvement to the overall texture of the skin. This treatment is most commonly used on the face and neck but any part of the body can be treated that exhibit wrinkles, discoloration or acne scarring. This treatment can be used over active cystic acne, acne scars, and melasma. It is safe for all skin types. 

Fractora can be combined with other treatments including Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), other energy treatments or injectables to achieve a more extensive full face result.
