This treatment is most commonly used on the face and neck but any part of the body can be treated that exhibit wrinkles, discoloration or acne scarring. This treatment can be used over active cystic acne, acne scars, and melasma. It is safe for all skin types.

**Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Facial
**

Improve:

* Skin tone, texture and acne scars
* Tighten skin that has started to lose its elasticity
* Soften fine lines and reduce pore size

PRP is a natural product created from your own body. Blood is drawn from you and placed into a centrifuge. Your blood is spun down allowing the separation of red and white blood cells from the platelets and plasma. Platelets are the cells in the blood that help tissue to heal and grow new cells. When PRP is injected into the skin it helps promote collagen to grow, regenerate tissue, and help to smooth and tighten the skin.  

PRP is used for adding volume to faces that are beginning to look drawn, plump out cheek indentations, soften under eye hollows, improve skin tone, tightness, and overall texture. PRP has a long history of being used in orthopedic medicine, dentistry, and reconstructive surgery. Results from this treatment begin to show 3-4 weeks post treatment and continue to improve with time. Three treatment sessions are generally recommended, 4-6 weeks apart, to achieve the best outcome.

PRP can be combined with laser, BOTOX, injectables to best target a patient’s unique issues and thus achieve desired results of younger, healthier looking skin.
