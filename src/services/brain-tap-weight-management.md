## What is BrainTap?
BrainTap’s innovative technology produces “brainwave entrainment”- the harmonization of brainwaves to a specialized sound- much like meditation but requires no special training or experience. While meditation has been proven to help stress management and relaxation, learning effective meditation techniques can require years of disciplined effort. BrainTap produces the same relaxation response, giving your body precisely what it needs to get back in balance and reverse the effect of stress on the body.

This innovative tool was developed after decades of research by Dr. Richard Porter to help patients achieve balanced brainwave activity needed for optimal function of body and mind.

Each session on BrainTap is individually designed to ensure the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, resulting in a flexible and resilient brain.

## Benefits of Using BrainTap
The BrainTap headset and programs help build mind body balance just like balancing your exercise at the gym with a healthy diet. Benefits of BrainTap include

* Deep relaxation stimulates the production
of natural, stress and tension-relieving
neurotransmitters, such as endorphins
* Helps change unwanted behaviors and
habits, including those contributing to
smoking and over-eating
* Balances the brain’s right and left
hemispheres, inspiring both focus and
creativity
* Promotes relaxation, which contributes to
maintaining healthy sleep
* Brings more blood flow to the brain for
clearer thinking and better concentration
* Alleviates negative mind chatter and
enhances motivation and performance
* Decreases or eliminates jet lag
* Provides a natural ability to put stress in
its place

Most users report stress relief through deep relaxation, maintaining healthy sleep patterns, improved memory, improved learning skills such as concentration and recall of information, a sense of calm, increased focus, lucid dreaming, and
increased physical energy. Please be aware that while the BrainTap technology is designed to help you reach your full potential, we cannot guarantee your results. Please understand that results will vary from person to person.
