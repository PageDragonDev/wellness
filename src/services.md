  Think of this as a tool to help on your weight management journey.  We will take a look at what your root cause is for your weight struggles and help put together a treatment plan that best fits your wellness goals.  We look at your hormones, adrenals (thyroid), and genetics to determine the personalized course of action for you.

nutrient_support: >-
  We do not always have the time or resources when it comes to proper diet and nutrition. Many diseases are the result of long-lasting nutritional imbalance, which shows the importance of replenishing these vitamins and minerals. Nutritional Therapy can help!


  Here at Centered on Wellness, our mission is to provide total person wellness and care. Each of us is created uniquely and therefore requires different care.  Often you can benefit from a combination of oral supplements and nutrient infusion therapy to help “catch you up” from your accumulated nutritional losses


  Nutrient Therapy is a specific treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs based upon lab results and your clinical findings.  Nutrient Infusion Therapy delivers high doses of these vitamins and essential elements when it is needed the most, rapidly replenishing your body. Treatment plans are a process that requires team work between a Centered on Wellness practitioner and yourself.

stress_management: >-
  We live in an age of constant stress and strain physically, mentally, and emotionally.  We are often nutritionally depleted and without the support we need to get re-balanced.  The standard solution currently is to be put on medication that promises to blunt our response and help us feel calm while offering no real lasting solutions.  If you are looking for an alternative way with lasting solutions Centered on Wellness can help!


  Here at Centered on Wellness, our mission is to provide total person wellness and care. Each of us is created uniquely and therefore requires different care.  We can help you find balance and provide the nutritional support that you need using real lasting solutions.  


  To begin this process, we would set you up for a meet and greet with our patient care coordinator, where she will bring you into the office to get a tour of the facility, fill out your necessary paperwork, and receive more detailed information of what to expect during this process.  Next you will be scheduled for a consultation where you will discuss your health history and wellness goals with one of our providers.  Lab work will be ordered and can be done in our office for your convenience.  Once your lab work is received, we will schedule you for a lab review to discuss in detail your results and to formulate your treatment plan.  There will be check-ins along the way of your treatment plan to ensure your wellness goals are on track to be met.
