  Building on the work of the late John Myers, MD, the author has used an
  intravenous vitamin-and-mineral formula for the treatment of a wide range of
  clinical conditions. The modified “Myers’ cocktail,” which consists of
  magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin C, has been found to be effective
  against acute asthma attacks, migraines, fatigue (including chronic fatigue
  syndrome), fibromyalgia, acute muscle spasm, upper respiratory tract
  infections, chronic sinusitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, cardiovascular
  disease, and other disorders. This paper presents a rationale for the
  therapeutic use of intravenous nutrients, reviews the relevant published
  clinical research, describes the author’s clinical experiences, and discusses
  potential side effects and precautions.
